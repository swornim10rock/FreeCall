<> Broadcast receiver registeration can be done in the two ways:
1. By using the static file (manifest file)
2. dynamically using the source code on start and on pause method( not compulsory)

if dyanamic then the app must be running to receive the broadcast by the system
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for manifest file you should use the tag
<application>
  <receiver android:name=".AlertReceiver"> //name of the class that extends the broadcastreceiver
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED"/>
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>
        .
        .
        .
        </application>


   * LocalBroadcastmanager class is used to register and unregister for and send broadcasts of intents
   to local objects within the process(for dynamic broadcast receiver)
